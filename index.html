   <p> The amount of older women who have told me I would make someone very happy some day after tasting this fudge is too many to count on my hands. Now I would hope that if i ever married it wouldn't just be because of the fudge, but I'm sure it would certainly help. As a quick forewarning, if you're lactose intolerant, I would take a lactaid or prepare for a very long trip to the bathroom at the very least. I once fed them to this girl that I didn't like, though I told her it was mainly dairy, and she ate an entire plate. I didn't see her for the next two days after that. </P>

   <p> For this recipe, you'll need: </p>
   <ul>
     <li>Three cups of chocolate chips (or blocks, either works)</li>
     <li> Sweetened Condensed Milk,the 14 ounce can </li>
     <li> 1/4 of a cup of butter </li>
   </ul>
   <p> Now this recipe is pretty flexible, and is very much just a blueprint for everytype of fudge you can image. Peanut butter, chocolate, cookies and cream, maple walnut, etc. In order to make it your own, you just need to replace the chocolate chips with the flavor of your choice. To make the maple walnut flavor, I simply substitute in white choclate with several drops of maple extract. I prefer to add the walnuts in after panning it, but you can mix them in right on the stove if you'd like. </p>
    
    <p> Again, this recipe is pretty flexible, and so are it's steps. All you need to cook the fudge is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> A stove (Do NOT microwave this, you heathens)</li>
      <li> A pot </li>
      <li> A double boiler </li>
      <li> an 8x8 pan-or a pan that you already own with a close measurement. Remember, the smaller the pan the thicker the pieces and the larger the pan the thinner the pieces. </li>
      <li> Wax paper </li>
      <li> A fridge or a cool place for storage </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Fill the pot with water and place the double boiler on top, with the chocolate and butter inside. place the stove on a medium heat, and let those ingredients melt. If the water starts to boil TURN OFF THE STOVE. It'll continue to melt even if it's off but we can't let the chocolate get too hot. Before we do anything else, I have two rules and they are very important: DO NOT LET THE WATER TOUCH ANY OF THE CHOCOLATE. If ANY of the water comes in contact with that chocolate the entirety of the fudge will be ruined. You'll have to start over if this happens. If it does happen, make sure to wash out the double boiler and COMPLETELY DRY IT. We don't want to make the same mistake twice. My second rule: CONSISTANTLY STIR. The chocolate will burn at the bottom and again, the fudge will be ruined. Back to business then. After the chocolate and butter have melted and been mixed together, add the sweetened condensed milk. You can add it while the other ingredients are still solid but most times it goes badly, spilling out the sides. You can now turn off the stove and just mix it all together. </p>

    <p> Remember not to let it cool completely in the double boiler. Put a sheet of wax paper in your pan with plenty of give around the edges, and pour over. Once you've done that, make sure that you put it in the fridge on a flat surface. Cool for about 20-25 minutes, and then cut. You decide how big. You can make tiny little finger pieces with tooth picks in them or you can make large squares to send with your kids back to college. Either way, the fudge will melt in your mouth (or on your counter if you leave it there overnight) Remember to refrigerate and clean up your area! Enjoy! </p>
